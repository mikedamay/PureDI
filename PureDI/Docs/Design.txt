Typemap contains relationships between the types of potential references and the required implementation.

mapObjectsCreatedSoFar (member of injection state) contains each implementation injected together with bean name and constructor name

The typemap needs to indicate the difference between a generic reference and a non-generic reference.

a) The typemap maps a relationship between the type of an implementation (bean) and all the interfaces and classes in
the class hierarchy through which it can be referenced including the type of the implementation itself.
b) It should report cases where duplicate beans exist for some interface or parent class.
c) Beans with a matching profile or no profile should be included.  Beans with a non-matching profile are completely ignored.
d) Where multiple beans exist derived from some interface or parent class then the typemap should include
the bean with a matching profile in preference to one with no profile.
e) Beans with any OS or matching OS should be included.
f) Where there is a choice between a bean with a matching OS and one with any OS then the matching one should be used.
g) If there is a bean with any OS and a matching profile and a bean with a matching OS but no profile then the one
   with the matching profile is selected and the other is reported as an issue.
   Order of Precedence:
	1) Os && Profile
	2) Profile
	3) Os
	4) Vanilla
