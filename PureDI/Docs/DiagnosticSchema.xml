      classes.  Note that although the bean reference 
      where the injection takes place may be specified as a base

      not a concrete class or struct.  (In the case of duplicates the details should be listed

      to mark as injectable a non-bean class such as a primitive, dynamic, tuple, array or 3rd party library class.
      This, of course, amounts to much the same thing.
