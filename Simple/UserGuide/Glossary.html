            <h4>Bean</h4>
<p>The documentation uses the term, <em>Bean</em>, rather loosely.  It refers either to a class
marked with the <code>[Bean]</code> attribute which is ready to be injected into
some other class by the container.  The name may seem a little misleading
as beans imply something small and uniform.  You might expect the name
to apply to value objects such as DTOs but beans are more typically singletons
such as services or repositories.  Blame <a href="http://spring.io">Spring</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the term bean is used to refer to an instantiated object of such a class.</p>
<h4>Injection</h4>
<p><em>Injection</em> is the process of assignment by the container of some object
to the member variable or constructor parameter of some other object.  It sometimes
loosely extended to include the creation of the ineected object.</p>
<h4>Dependency</h4>
<p>The documentation uses the term, <em>Dependency</em>, to refer to the relationship
between two classes where one is an class to be injected and the other
has a member which refers to the bean.</p>
<h4>Injectable</h4>
<p>More descriptive synonym for a bean.</p>
<h4>Injection Site</h4>
<p>Either a member variable or a constructor parmeter marked as a <code>[BeanReference]</code></p>
<h4>(Object) Tree</h4>
<p>Also known as the object model.  This is a conceptual construct which sees
the objects related by a set of injections with a root object (being the
type passed to <code>CreateAndInjectDependnecies</code>.</p>
<h4>Container</h4>
<p>The container controls the creation of the object tree and retains meta
data so that additions can be made to the tree at subsequent entry points
to the program.</p>
<h4>Prototype</h4>
<p>This terminology is borrowed from Spring rather than javascript or
the GOF design patern.  The object created to be assigned to a
<code>[BeanReference(Scope=Scope.Prorotype]</code> marked as a prototype is
is not make part of the object tree but treated as a one-off.</p>
<h4>Singleton</h4>
<p>This term is typically applied to services, repositories or other objects
orchestrating the workflow of the application.  There tends to be only
one of each type of object fulfilling a particular role.</p>
