            <p>Any concrete class or struct over which you control the
source can be marked as a bean by applying the <code>[Bean]</code> attribute
to the class declaration.</p>
<p>Primitive types (such as int, string) etc. cannot be beans.
An attempt to make them beans results in a compiler error.</p>
<p>Interfaces, abstract classes and static classes cannot be beans.
A run-time warning will be recorded in the <em>Diagnostics</em> object.</p>
<p>An inherited class cannot be a bean if any of its derived classes
are beans (unless the inherited bean is given a different bean name
to that of the derived bean or one of them has a matching profile
and the other does not).  (Without
a bean name to distinguish them there is no way for the container
to determine whether a reference to the inherited class is intended
to refer to the inherited class itself or a derived class.)  Alternatively
if you mark the inherited bean as <code>[IOCCIgnored]</code> then both beans can be
injected but only through their respective implementation class types.</p>
