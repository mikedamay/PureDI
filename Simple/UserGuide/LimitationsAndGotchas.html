            <h4>Limitations</h4>
<ol>
<li>The object model is static - although new objects can be added at program entry points
there is no facility to remove anything.  This will be addressed in the case of
request and session scope objects for web applications in a future version.  In
the mean time where this is necessary beans will have to be created with Prototype scope</li>
<li><code>static</code> classes and members are not handled</li>
<li><code>readonly</code> properties cannot have their value set by injection.  A constructor
or field must be involved.
is called.</li>
<li>Variadic constructors are not supported</li>
<li>It is not possible to combine alternative implementations with parallel implementations.
Suppose we have an IRepository interface and two concrete classes that implement it say
ILocalRepository and IRemoteRepository.  We cannot fulfill a reqauirement where a) in
production some classes need the LocalRepository (say for configuration settings) and
some classes the RemoteRepository (for general use) and b) on the developer machine
both repositories should be LocalRepository.  In the first case we need the remote
repostory to have a bean <strong>name</strong>, say &quot;remote&quot; and in the second case a <strong>profile</strong>
but no <strong>name</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Gotchas</h4>
<ol>
<li>If a member is incorrectly marked as [IOCCBeanReference] then
it will be set to its default value even if it is an initialized member</li>
<li>Factories must both have a <code>[bean]</code> attribute and implement <code>IFactory</code>.  If a factory
has only one of these then this will be recorded in diagnostics (<code>IOCCDiagnostics</code>)</li>
<li>A risk, particularly with multiple entry points, is that the coder will forget
to include required assemblies when the container is created</li>
<li>If a number of beans implement some widely used interface such as <code>IEnumerable of T</code> then
each implementing class involved will require bean names so that the container can
select the appropriate bean for a given injection whith the widely used type</li>
<li>For factories the bean name (if present) refers to the selection of the factory.
It does not relate in any way to the class which is instantiated by the factory</li>
<li><code>CreateAndInjectDependencies()</code> is not thread safe</li>
<li>As you would expect beans have not been injected when the class's constructor</li>
