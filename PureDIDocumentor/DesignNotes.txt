DocumentationSiteGenerator/IOCCDocumentProcessor (created by Startup ConfigureServices)
						   (GenerateSite is invoked at the start of App.Run )
						   provide the parser with a document path literal and a root node literal
    Each instance of IOCCDocumentParser is built using the [IOCCDocumentParser] attribute (derived from BeanReferenceAttribute)
	IOCCDocumentParaer (for user guide - takes resource id of doc)
		CodeFetcher
		IOCCXPathNavigatorCache - prototype (resource id is assigned by the factory)
	IOCCDocumentParser (for diagnostics - takes resource id of doc)

	In summary communicating the resource id from the DocumentationSiteGenerator
	where it is specified to the customized navigation cache where it is used
	is through the IOCCDocumentParserAttribute which is the factory which
	passes the resource id to the navigation cache's constructor.  The injector
	subsequently instantiates the navigation cache and when it is assigned to
	the IOCCDocumentParser the resource id is assigned to the navigation cache's
	resource id member.  On assignment the cache creates an XPathNavigator using
	an XPathNavigator factory (also provided by IOCCDocumentParserAttribute).
