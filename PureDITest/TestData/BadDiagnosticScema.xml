    <intro>Duplicate beans have been detected.  
           The IOC container will be unable to determine which 
           class an injected reference refers to</intro>
    <userGuide>If there are multiple implementations of some 
               interface or base class then use the bean's "name" 
               property to distinguish them and then include that 
               name in the bean reference whose value is to be injected</userGuide>

    <intro>A piece of code has been marked as a bean (with 
          the "IOCCBean" attribute) which is not capable of being 
          a bean.  Only concrete classes can be beans.</intro>
    <userGuide>Typically this problem occurs with abstract 
               classes.  Note that although the bean reference 
               where the injection takes place may be specified as a base
               class or interface, the "IOCCBean" attribute should be applied 
               only to the concrete implementation, not to a parent 
               or interface</userGuide>
