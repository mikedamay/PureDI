    <intro>Duplicate beans have been detected.  
           The IOC container will be unable to determine which 
           class an injected reference refers to</intro>
    <userGuide>If there are multiple implementations of some 
               interface or base class then use the bean's "name" 
               property to distinguish them and then include that 
               name in the bean reference whose value is to be injected</userGuide>

    <userGuide>Typically this problem occurs with abstract and static
      classes.  Note that although the bean reference 
      where the injection takes place may be specified as a base
      class or interface, the "Bean" attribute should be applied 
      only to the concrete implementation, not to a parent 
      or interface</userGuide>

    <intro>A reference to a missing bean has been encountered</intro>
    <userGuide>The most likely cause of this issue is that 
      you forgot to mark a bean with [Bean] or omitted its name for the [BeanReference] 
      or there are 
      duplicate beans or that the bean referred to was
      not a concrete class or struct.  (In the case of duplicates the details should be listed
      in the relevant diagnostics above).  Alternatively you may have attempted
      to mark as injectable a non-bean class such as a primitive, dynamic, tuple, array or 3rd party library class.
      This, of course, amounts to much the same thing.
      You may be attempting the bean through an interface that it does not implement.</userGuide>
