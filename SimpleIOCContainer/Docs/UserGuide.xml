    <userGuide>
The SimpleIOCContainer (Simple Inversion of Control Container) is a
Dependency Injection (DI) framework focused on simplicity of use and
rich diagnostics.

Usage follows a simple pattern the caller instantiates some key object
with a call to SimpleIOCContainer.CreateAndInjectDependnecies and that
object is instiated together with dependencies to which it refers
and so forth recursively through the tree of dependencies.

Even more stuff here.
